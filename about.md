### Who am I ?

Hi everyone! I'm currently living & studying in Paris in Master's degree in Quantum Computing, Machine Learning & High Performance Computing at University Paris-Saclay. Before I did a double bachelor in Maths & Physics. Otherwise, I spend also some gap years to grow in maturity by making better reflections on myself, develop many soft skills & discover other horizons. Finally, I answered to me some conclusions about the creation & life after death...
