### Who am I ?

Hi everyone! I currently live & study in Paris in Master's degree in Quantum Computing, Machine Learning & High Performance Computing at University Paris-Saclay. Before I did a double bachelor in Maths & Physics. I spend also some gap years to grow in maturity by making better reflections on myself, develop many soft skills & discover other horizons.
