## Abstract 

We discuss the construction of entanglers in 2-player-N-strategies quantum games. In these games, each player has a normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space upon which they apply their strategy. The players draw their payoffs from a state determined by an unentangled 2-quNit state and a unitary operator, which is partially entangled. The degree of entanglement of the state is related to the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the quantum game. The paper suggests an algorithm to construct a special quantum gate that should be useful not only in quantum games but also as a special gate in manipulating quantum information protocols. The gate generates partially entangled states whose degree of entanglement is controlled by a single real parameter, and this property is referred to as single parameter completeness. The paper discusses the relevance of the problem to quantum information and suggests an extension of the algorithm to $N>2$.

A normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{H}$ can be represented as: $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{N}\mathcal{H}$, $\mid\vec{x}\mid = 1$, where $\mid\cdot\mid$ denotes the norm.
