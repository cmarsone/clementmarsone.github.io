## Abstract 

We discuss the construction of entanglers in 2-player-N-strategies quantum games. In these games, each player has a normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space upon which they apply their strategy. A normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_ \mathcal{N}$ can be represented as: $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{H}_ \mathcal{N}$, $\mid\vec{x}\mid = 1$, where $\mid\cdot\mid$ denotes the norm. The players draw their payoffs from a state $\vert \Psi \rangle = J^{\dagger}U_1 \otimes U_2 J \vert \Psi_0 \rangle \in \mathcal{H}_ N \otimes \mathcal{H}_ N$. Here, $\vert \Psi_0 \rangle$ and $J$ (both determined by the game’s referee) are respectively an unentangled $2$-qubit (pure) state and a unitary operator such that $\vert \Psi_1 \rangle \equiv J\vert \Psi_0 \rangle \in \mathcal{H}_ N \otimes \mathcal{H}_ N$ is partially entangled. The degree of entanglement of the state is related to the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the quantum game. The paper suggests an algorithm to construct a special quantum gate that should be useful not only in quantum games but also as a special gate in manipulating quantum information protocols. The gate generates partially entangled states whose degree of entanglement is controlled by a single real parameter, and this property is referred to as single parameter completeness. The paper discusses the relevance of the problem to quantum information and suggests an extension of the algorithm to $N>2$.

## Introduction

The theory of quantum games is a growing area of research that explores the application of quantum mechanics to fields outside of physics, such as economics, finance, and gambling. This is done by "quantizing" classical games, which involves formulating rules and allowing players to use quantum information tools, such as qubits and quantum gates, to make decisions. One example of a quantum game is the 2-2 game, which is based on a classical game that involves two players and two strategies

## The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Games

There is significant research on the quantized version of classical strategic $2-2$ games, with most of it based on a protocol specified in [Quantum Games and Quantum Strategies](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.3077). The protocol requires the application of an entanglement (unitary) operator $J(β)$, where $β$ is a real parameter, on a non-entangled 2-qubit (pure) state. The resulting state is entangled, and its degree of entanglement is measured by its von-Neumann entropy $2S(β)$. A desired property of $J(β)$ is that $2S(β)$ is a continuous function of $β$ that varies between $0$ and $\log2$ (maximal entanglement). The degree of entanglement is crucial for the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the $2-2$ quantum game. The problem of controlling the entropy by a single parameter that varies between $0$ and $\log2$ is known as single parameter completeness. The design of an entanglement gate $J(β)$ that generates entangled states with a degree of entanglement controlled by a single parameter should be useful in quantum information.

## Classical Commensurability

The passage describes the construction and properties of a parameterized entangler $J(\beta)$ for a 2-2 quantum game. The entangler can be constructed easily from classical strategies, and its action on an unentangled 2-qubit state yields a Schmidt-decomposed form, enabling the computation of the corresponding entanglement entropy. The entangler satisfies single parameter completeness and is periodic and symmetric. The entangler also has a property called classical commensurability, which means that players in a 2-2 quantum game can use their classical strategies as a special case and collect the corresponding classical payoffs. However, classical commensurability does not hold for $N > 2$. The specific details of the entangler and its properties are as follows:

In a 2-2 game, the classical strategy of a player is denoted by $i\sigma_y \in SU(2)$, and $J(\beta) = e^{-i\beta/2}\sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y$ is an appropriate construction for the entangler. The action of $J(\beta)$ on an unentangled 2-qubit state, such as $|00\rangle$, yields $J(\beta)|00\rangle = \cos(\beta/2)|00\rangle - i\sin(\beta/2)|11\rangle$. The Schmidt-decomposed form of $|\Psi_1\rangle = J(\beta)|00\rangle$ enables the computation of the corresponding entanglement entropy $S_2(\beta)$, which is a continuous function of $\beta$ and gets all values in $[0,\log 2]$. $S_2(\beta)$ is periodic with period $\pi$, symmetric about the midpoint $\pi/2$, with $S_2(0) = 0$ and $S_2(\pi/2) = \log 2$. $J(\beta)$ satisfies single parameter completeness. $J(\beta)$ has a property referred to as classical commensurability, $[J(\beta),\sigma_y\otimes\sigma_y]=0$, which means that players in a 2-2 quantum game can use their classical strategies as a special case and collect the corresponding classical payoffs. Classical commensurability does not hold for $N > 2$.

## The present work

The article examines now the construction of the entangler $J(\beta)$ for a 2-N quantum game based on a 2-players-N-strategies classical game. For N=3,4, the corresponding von-Neumann entropy $S_N(\beta)$ satisfies single parameter completeness. However, for N>4, $S_N(\beta) < \log N$, and another method is suggested to design $J(\beta)$ that satisfies single parameter completeness for any N. The article introduces the classical 2-3 game and formulates its quantum version before addressing the construction of $J(\beta)$.

## Two-Players-Three-Strategies Classical Games: Trits

The article introduces a classical game played by two players with three strategies each, exemplified by the options of confessing, staying quiet, or not confessing in a game between two prisoners. The game is played using nine two-trit states representing the entries of the game table. The players are initially given the state |11〉, which corresponds to both players confessing, and are asked to choose whether to keep their trit state as it is or change it to |2〉 (staying quiet) or |3〉 (not confessing). The group of permutations of three elements, S3, is generated by the replacement operations or classical strategies.

To "quantize" the game, the article proposes constructing a representation of S3 using unitary matrices with unit determinant, with the requirement that the classical strategies should be special cases of quantum ones. An SU(3) matrix is used to represent a quantum strategy. For example, if player 1 chooses strategy S12 and player 2 chooses strategy S13, the system is brought into a state of |23〉 or |SD〉, and the respective payoffs of each player are determined by the entry in the game table corresponding to their chosen strategies.
