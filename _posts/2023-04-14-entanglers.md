## Abstract 

We discuss the construction of entanglers in 2-player-N-strategies quantum games. In these games, each player has a normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space upon which they apply their strategy. A normalized vector in an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_ \mathcal{N}$ can be represented as: $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{H}_ \mathcal{N}$, $\mid\vec{x}\mid = 1$, where $\mid\cdot\mid$ denotes the norm. The players draw their payoffs from a state $\vert \Psi \rangle = J^{\dagger}U_1 \otimes U_2 J \vert \Psi_0 \rangle \in \mathcal{H}_ N \otimes \mathcal{H}_ N$. Here, $\vert \Psi_0 \rangle$ and $J$ (both determined by the game’s referee) are respectively an unentangled $2$-qubit (pure) state and a unitary operator such that $\vert \Psi_1 \rangle \equiv J\vert \Psi_0 \rangle \in \mathcal{H}_ N \otimes \mathcal{H}_ N$ is partially entangled. The degree of entanglement of the state is related to the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the quantum game. The paper suggests an algorithm to construct a special quantum gate that should be useful not only in quantum games but also as a special gate in manipulating quantum information protocols. The gate generates partially entangled states whose degree of entanglement is controlled by a single real parameter, and this property is referred to as single parameter completeness. The paper discusses the relevance of the problem to quantum information and suggests an extension of the algorithm to $N>2$.

## Introduction

The theory of quantum games is a growing area of research that explores the application of quantum mechanics to fields outside of physics, such as economics, finance, and gambling. This is done by "quantizing" classical games, which involves formulating rules and allowing players to use quantum information tools, such as qubits and quantum gates, to make decisions. One example of a quantum game is the 2-2 game, which is based on a classical game that involves two players and two strategies

## The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Games

There is significant research on the quantized version of classical strategic $2-2$ games, with most of it based on a protocol specified in [Quantum Games and Quantum Strategies](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.3077). The protocol requires the application of an entanglement (unitary) operator $J(β)$, where $β$ is a real parameter, on a non-entangled 2-qubit (pure) state. The resulting state is entangled, and its degree of entanglement is measured by its von-Neumann entropy $2S(β)$. A desired property of $J(β)$ is that $2S(β)$ is a continuous function of $β$ that varies between $0$ and $\log2$ (maximal entanglement). The degree of entanglement is crucial for the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium in the $2-2$ quantum game. The problem of controlling the entropy by a single parameter that varies between $0$ and $\log2$ is known as single parameter completeness. The design of an entanglement gate $J(β)$ that generates entangled states with a degree of entanglement controlled by a single parameter should be useful in quantum information.

## Classical Commensurability

The passage describes the construction and properties of a parameterized entangler $J(\beta)$ for a 2-2 quantum game. The entangler can be constructed easily from classical strategies, and its action on an unentangled 2-qubit state yields a Schmidt-decomposed form, enabling the computation of the corresponding entanglement entropy. The entangler satisfies single parameter completeness and is periodic and symmetric. The entangler also has a property called classical commensurability, which means that players in a 2-2 quantum game can use their classical strategies as a special case and collect the corresponding classical payoffs. However, classical commensurability does not hold for $N > 2$. The specific details of the entangler and its properties are as follows:

In a 2-2 game, the classical strategy of a player is denoted by $i\sigma_y \in SU(2)$, and $J(\beta) = e^{-i\beta/2}\sigma_y \otimes \sigma_y$ is an appropriate construction for the entangler. The action of $J(\beta)$ on an unentangled 2-qubit state, such as $|00\rangle$, yields $J(\beta)|00\rangle = \cos(\beta/2)|00\rangle - i\sin(\beta/2)|11\rangle$. The Schmidt-decomposed form of $|\Psi_1\rangle = J(\beta)|00\rangle$ enables the computation of the corresponding entanglement entropy $S_2(\beta)$, which is a continuous function of $\beta$ and gets all values in $[0,\log 2]$. $S_2(\beta)$ is periodic with period $\pi$, symmetric about the midpoint $\pi/2$, with $S_2(0) = 0$ and $S_2(\pi/2) = \log 2$. $J(\beta)$ satisfies single parameter completeness. $J(\beta)$ has a property referred to as classical commensurability, $[J(\beta),\sigma_y\otimes\sigma_y]=0$, which means that players in a 2-2 quantum game can use their classical strategies as a special case and collect the corresponding classical payoffs. Classical commensurability does not hold for $N > 2$.

## The present work

The article examines now the construction of the entangler $J(\beta)$ for a 2-N quantum game based on a 2-players-N-strategies classical game. For N=3,4, the corresponding von-Neumann entropy $S_N(\beta)$ satisfies single parameter completeness. However, for N>4, $S_N(\beta) < \log N$, and another method is suggested to design $J(\beta)$ that satisfies single parameter completeness for any N. The article introduces the classical 2-3 game and formulates its quantum version before addressing the construction of $J(\beta)$.

## Two-Players-Three-Strategies Classical Games: Trits

The article introduces a classical game played by two players with three strategies each, exemplified by the options of confessing, staying quiet, or not confessing in a game between two prisoners. The game is played using nine two-trit states representing the entries of the game table. The players are initially given the state |11〉, which corresponds to both players confessing, and are asked to choose whether to keep their trit state as it is or change it to |2〉 (staying quiet) or |3〉 (not confessing). The group of permutations of three elements, S3, is generated by the replacement operations or classical strategies.

To "quantize" the game, the article proposes constructing a representation of S3 using unitary matrices with unit determinant, with the requirement that the classical strategies should be special cases of quantum ones. An SU(3) matrix is used to represent a quantum strategy. For example, if player 1 chooses strategy S12 and player 2 chooses strategy S13, the system is brought into a state of |23〉 or |SD〉, and the respective payoffs of each player are determined by the entry in the game table corresponding to their chosen strategies.

## The Analogous Quantum Game: 1 and 2 Quirt States

The article introduces a quantum version of the classical game previously discussed. The quantum game uses qutrits, quantum strategies, and entanglement operations. Qutrits are vectors in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, denoted by H3, with orthonormal basis vectors |1〉, |2〉, and |3〉. A qutrit |ψ〉 is a vector of unit norm in H3, written as |ψ〉= v1|1〉 + v2|2〉 + v3|3〉, where |v1|2 + |v2|2 + |v3|2 = 1. A general 2-qutrit state is a normalized vector in the tensor product of two copies of H3, written as |Ψ〉= ∑vij |ij〉, where vij is a complex number and the sum over i and j is from 1 to 3. A maximally entangled two-qutrit state is written as |Ψ〉ME = (1/√3)(u1|11〉+u2|22〉+u3|33〉), where ui is a complex number with unit norm and the sum over i is from 1 to 3. The entanglement degree of the maximally entangled state is measured by the von Neumann entropy S3, which is equal to log 3. The quantum game uses the same game table as the classical game, but the payoff rules are different.

## Quantum Game Strategies

In a 2-3 quantum game, a player's strategy is represented by an SU(3) matrix that acts on their qutrit as a quantum gate. This strategy, denoted as U(γ) ∈ SU(3), depends on eight Euler angles γ = {α1, α2, ..., α8}. The explicit expression of U(γ) can be written in terms of Gellman matrices {λm}, where m = 1, 2, ..., 8. This expression is well-known.

## 2-3 Quantum Game Procedure

The referee proposes a non-entangled two-qutrit initial state, denoted by $|\Psi_0\rangle$, and applies a unitary operator $J(\beta)$ to entangle the state. The construction of $J(\beta)$ is the main goal and is explained later. The players apply their respective quantum strategies $U_1\otimes U_2$ to the state $|\Psi_1\rangle=J(\beta)|\Psi_0\rangle$. Finally, the referee applies the operator $J^\dagger(\beta)$ to get the final state $|\Psi\rangle=J^\dagger(\beta)U_1\otimes U_2J(\beta)|\Psi_0\rangle=\sum_{i,j=1,3}v_{ij}|ij\rangle$. Here, $\gamma_k$ is the octet of 8 Euler angles defining the $SU(3)$ matrix $U(\gamma_k)$, which represents the strategy of player $k=1,2$. The payoff of player $k$ is denoted by $P_k(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ and is given by $\sum_{i,j=1,3}u_k(i,j)|v_{ij}(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)|^2$, where $u_k(i,j)$ are the payoffs in the corresponding entry $(i,j)$ of the classical game table. Each player chooses a strategy with the aim of maximizing their respective payoff.

## Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE)

The set of eight Euler angles $\gamma$ determines a player's strategy $U(\gamma) \in SU(3)$, and a pure strategy NE in the 2-3 quantum game is a pair of strategies $(\gamma^_1,\gamma^_2)$, each represented by eight angles, such that $P_1(\gamma_1, \gamma^_2) \leq P_1(\gamma^_1, \gamma^_2)$ for all $\gamma_1$ and $P_2(\gamma^_1, \gamma_2) \leq P_2(\gamma^_1, \gamma^_2)$ for all $\gamma_2$. The existence of a pure strategy NE in the 2-2 quantum game and its relationship with the degree of entanglement, controlled by $\beta$, has been discussed in several works. In brief, if there is a NE in the classical game that is not Pareto efficient, then there exists a critical value $\beta_c$ above which there is no pure strategy NE in the quantum game. As $\beta$ approaches $\beta_c$ from below, the respective payoffs in the quantum game at NE approach the Pareto point of cooperation. This is the main reason why partially entangled 2-quNit states where $S_N(\beta) < \log N$ are relevant.

## Absence of Classical Commensurability

We will now explain why there is no classical commensurability in a 2-3 quantum game, as stated in reference [10]. In classical commensurability, the players get their classical payoffs when they use classical strategies. If we take a classical strategy $\gamma$, it belongs to $S_3$, where $U_\gamma$ is a unitary permutation matrix. From Equation (6), it follows that $J$ should commute with all outer products of classical strategies. If the initial state is $|\Psi\rangle = |11\rangle$, then the 9 outer products of classical strategies are $1\otimes 2^s \otimes s$, where $s \in {1,2,3}$ and ${1,2,3}^{\otimes 2}={12,13,21,23,31,32}$ (see Equation (3)). Classical commensurability requires that $[J, \otimes_{S\in{1,2,3}^{\otimes 2}} U_S^{\otimes s}] = 0$, which leads to Equation (9): $[J,\otimes_{S\in{1,2,3}}U_S^{\otimes 2}] = 0$. This is only possible if $J$ is a function of $A\otimes A$, where $A$ is a $3\times 3$ matrix satisfying $A\otimes A = 0$ and $A$ is not just a multiple of the identity matrix $I$. However, this is impossible because $S_{12}$ and $S_{13}$ generate an irreducible representation of the permutation group $S_3$, and therefore, by Schur's lemma, $A$ is just a multiple of $I$. These arguments hold for any $N>2$.

## Designing the Entangler $J(\beta)$

The main result of the study concerns the construction of an entanglement operator $J_\beta$ for 2-qutrit states. The operator is constructed for $3$-qutrit states and extended to any $N$. The goal is to obtain an entangled 2-qutrit state with $\beta$ specifying the degree of entanglement that can range from $0$ to $\log 3$. The operator $J_\beta$ is constructed by exponentiating a combination of classical strategies. To obtain the diagonal 2-qutrit states $|2\rangle|2\rangle$ and $|3\rangle|3\rangle$ from $|1\rangle|1\rangle$, $J_\beta$ operates on $|1\rangle|1\rangle$ with $Z\otimes S\otimes S\otimes Z\otimes S\otimes S$, where $Z$ and $S$ are defined as quantum gates. The exponent of $J_\beta$ is calculated to obtain the entangled state. The maximal entanglement is obtained when the absolute values of all three coefficients are equal, which happens at $\beta = 2e^2-1$. The entanglement operator satisfies single-parameter completeness. The von Neumann entropy of the entangled state is displayed as a function of $\beta$ in Figure 1(a), showing that it is a periodic function of $\beta$ with a period of $4\pi/3$ and is symmetric about the midpoint $2\pi/3$. It has two maxima for $\beta=2e^2\pm1$, where it equals $3\log 3$. The entanglement in quantum games is obtained in terms of permutation exponentials that are SU(3) matrices.

## Extension to Arbitrary $N$

The main result of the study concerns the construction of an entanglement operator $J_\beta$ for 2-qutrit states. The operator is constructed for $3$-qutrit states and extended to any $N$. The goal is to obtain an entangled 2-qutrit state with $\beta$ specifying the degree of entanglement that can range from $0$ to $\log 3$. The operator $J_\beta$ is constructed by exponentiating a combination of classical strategies. To obtain the diagonal 2-qutrit states $|2\rangle|2\rangle$ and $|3\rangle|3\rangle$ from $|1\rangle|1\rangle$, $J_\beta$ operates on $|1\rangle|1\rangle$ with $Z\otimes S\otimes S\otimes Z\otimes S\otimes S$, where $Z$ and $S$ are defined as quantum gates. The exponent of $J_\beta$ is calculated to obtain the entangled state. The maximal entanglement is obtained when the absolute values of all three coefficients are equal, which happens at $\beta = 2e^2-1$. The entanglement operator satisfies single-parameter completeness. The von Neumann entropy of the entangled state is displayed as a function of $\beta$ in Figure 1(a), showing that it is a periodic function of $\beta$ with a period of $4\pi/3$ and is symmetric about the midpoint $2\pi/3$. It has two maxima for $\beta=2e^2\pm1$, where it equals $3\log 3$. The entanglement in quantum games is obtained in terms of permutation exponentials that are SU(3) matrices.

## Illustration for $N=5$

A convenient way to build an appropriate unitary $N \times N$ matrix $R$ is to start from a simple non-singular matrix $A$ and then orthogonalize it within the Grahm-Schmidt procedure.

Proceeding with the list of steps prescribed above we can easily construct $J(\beta)$ and compute the von Neumann entropy of the state $|\Psi_1\rangle = J(\beta) |11\rangle$ upon which the players apply their strategies according to the game protocol specified in Equation (6). The result is given in Figure 2. As explained in the figure’s caption, the degree of entanglement is controlled by a single parameter and $S_N(\beta)$ is a continuous function of $\beta$ reaching any value in the interval $[0, \log N]$. Thus we have achieved our goal of constructing an entangler $J(\beta)$ that turns a non-entangled 2-qubit state into an entangled one given in a Schmidt decomposed form with single parameter completeness satisfied.

## Wrap-Up

To summarize, we propose two ways to create an entanglement operator J(β) that transforms a non-entangled 2-quNit state into a partially entangled state with its von Neumann entropy controlled by a single parameter. The first method is straightforward and involves using classical strategies in an exponential equation, as shown in Equation (10) and Figure 1. However, this method only works for N ≤ 4 since the resulting entropy does not reach the maximum value of log N. Thus, we propose a second method that works for any N but is more complex. The resulting entropy as a function of β is depicted in Figure 2.
