#### Convex set

A set $U leg R^n$ is convex iff forall u, u^' in U, exists epsilon in 0, 1 s.t. epsilon u

#### Convex Hull

conv U = simplex 

#### Convex function 

*Convex sets* : A set $XâŠ†R^n$ is convex if and only if:
âˆ€x,xâ€² âˆˆX,Îµâˆˆ[0,1]:Îµx+(1âˆ’Îµ)xâ€² âˆˆX,
or, in other words, any point which is a convex combination of points in X must also be in X.

*Convex and concave functions*
LetXâŠ†Rn beaconvexset.Afunctionf:Xâ†’Risconvexifandonlyif:
âˆ€x,xâ€² âˆˆX,Îµâˆˆ[0,1]:f(Îµx+(1âˆ’Îµ)xâ€²)â‰¤Îµf(x)+(1âˆ’Îµ)f(xâ€²)
Note that the domain of the function is required to be convex so that the left-hand side is well defined. A function f is concave if and only if âˆ’f is convex.

Extended real value extension => transform a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained problem

Only at this subsection, we adopt the following rule:
0Â·âˆž = âˆžÂ·0 = 0Â·(âˆ’âˆž) = (âˆ’âˆž)Â·0 = 0.
Î¼2 2 +L âˆ’ Î¼âˆ¥x âˆ’ yâˆ¥2,
and the result follows after some simplifications.

*Extended Real-Valued Functions* : A function that can take values âˆ’âˆž or +âˆž is called an extended real-valued function. That is f : Rn â†’ [âˆ’âˆž, +âˆž]. We can also denote [âˆ’âˆž, +âˆž] by R âˆª {Â±âˆž}. The domain of this function is defined by the set dom(f) = {x âˆˆ Rn | f(x) < +âˆž}.

For an arbitrary set S âŠ‚ Rn, the indicator function of S is defined by the following
extended real-valued function:

A function f : Rn â†’ [âˆ’âˆž, +âˆž] is called *proper *if it does not attain the value âˆ’âˆž and dom(f) Ì¸= âˆ…. This function is called closed if its epigraph is a closed set.
A function f : Rn â†’ [âˆ’âˆž, +âˆž] is called lower *semicontinuous *at x âˆˆ R if f(x) â‰¤ lim inf f(xn)
nâ†’âˆž
for any sequence {xn}âˆžn=1 for which xn â†’ x. Therefore, a function f: Rn â†’ [âˆ’âˆž,+âˆž] is called
lower semicontinous if it is lower semicontinuous at each point of Rn.
Theorem 5.28 Let f : Rn â†’ [âˆ’âˆž, +âˆž]. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
1. f is lower semicontinuous.
2. f is closed.
3. For any Î» âˆˆ R, the Î»-level sets LÎ» of f (see Theorem 5.3) are closed.

Definition 5.29 An extended real-valued function f: Rn â†’ [âˆ’âˆž,+âˆž] is called convex if its epi-
graph is a convex set.
Therefore, we can show that the a proper extended real-valued function is a convex function if and only if it satisfies the condition for usual functions (Definition 5.1) using the rule (10).

### Subgradients

Definition 3.6: Subgradient
Given a function f : X âŠ† Rn â†’ R, a subgradient of f at x âˆˆ X is a vector g âˆˆ Rn such that: âˆ€xâ€²âˆˆX: f(xâ€²)â‰¥f(x)+gâŠ¤(xâ€²âˆ’x)
The set of subgradients at point x is called the subdifferential and is denoted âˆ‚f(x).

Properties:
f is convex 
- if f is differentiable at u then partial f(u) = {nab,a f(x)
- sub estimator h u' 
- super gradient is a similar definition for. oncave fucnrion

#### Fenchel conjugates

Fenchelâ€™s inequality
From the definition of conjugate function, we immediately obtain the inequality f(x) + fâˆ—(y) â‰¥ xT y
for all x, y. This is called Fenchelâ€™s inequality (or Youngâ€™s inequality when f is differentiable).
For example with f(x) = (1/2)xT Qx, where Q âˆˆ Sn++, we obtain the inequality xT y â‰¤ (1/2)xT Qx + (1/2)yT Qâˆ’1y.
Conjugate of the conjugate
The examples above, and the name â€˜conjugateâ€™, suggest that the conjugate of the conjugate of a convex function is the original function. This is the case provided a technical condition holds: if f is convex, and f is closed (i.e., epi f is a closed set; see Â§A.3.3), then fâˆ—âˆ— = f. For example, if domf = Rn, then we have fâˆ—âˆ— = f, i.e., the conjugate of the conjugate of f is f again 

Differentiable functions
The conjugate of a differentiable function f is also called the Legendre transform of f. (To distinguish the general definition from the differentiable case, the term Fenchel conjugate is sometimes used instead of conjugate.)
Suppose f is convex and differentiable, with domf = Rn. Any maximizer xâˆ— of yT xâˆ’f(x) satisfies y = âˆ‡f(xâˆ—), and conversely, if xâˆ— satisfies y = âˆ‡f(xâˆ—), then xâˆ— maximizes yT x âˆ’ f(x). Therefore, if y = âˆ‡f(xâˆ—), we have
fâˆ—(y) = xâˆ—T âˆ‡f(xâˆ—) âˆ’ f(xâˆ—).
This allows us to determine fâˆ—(y) for any y for which we can solve the gradient
Then we have fâˆ—(y) = zT âˆ‡f(z) âˆ’ f(z).




Jensen's inequality
let w =sum_i mu_ i w_i and g in partial f(w), we need w in dom f by previous theorem
by def of subgradient:
forall i f(w_ i) >= f(w) + <g, w_ i -w >
therefore sum _ i mu_ i f_i(w) >= sum mu_ i f(w) + sum mu i <g, w i-w> which is 0

example: is log-partition = log sum exp w_ i convex ? proof by jensen or holder s inequalities
