## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2):
- Provides *virtual machines* - refered to as EC2 instances - in the cloud
- Fives you full control over the guest operating system (Windows or Linux) on each instance

You can launch instances of any size into and Availability Zone anywhere in the world
- Launch instance from *Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)*
- Launch instances with a few clicks or a line of code, and they are ready in minutes

You can control traffic to and from instances

### Creating a new AMI:

1. Launch an instance
2. Connect to the instance and manually modify it or run a script that modifies the instance e.g. upgrade
3. Capture as a new AMI
4. Copy the AMI to any other Regions where you want to use it

### Select an instance type

The instance type that you choose determines –
• Memory (RAM)
• Processing power (CPU)
• Disk space and disk type (Storage)
• Network performance

Instance type categories –
• General purpose
• Compute optimized
• Memory optimized
• Storage optimized
• Accelerated computing

Instance type naming by *family*, *generation* and *size*. Example: *t3.large*
