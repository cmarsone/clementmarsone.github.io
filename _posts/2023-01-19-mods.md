*Simplex algorithm* : The simplex algorithm is a method for solving linear programming problems. It starts with an initial feasible solution and then iteratively moves to other solutions that are better (i.e., have higher or lower objective function values) until it finds the optimal solution or proves that none exists. The algorithm works by finding the direction in which the objective function can be improved the most and then moving in that direction as far as possible while still remaining feasible. At each iteration, it selects one of the variables to be the "pivot" and re-organizes the constraints and objective function in order to move to the next solution. The process continues until the objective function can no longer be improved or an unbounded solution is found.
