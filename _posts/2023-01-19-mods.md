*Simplex algorithm* : The simplex algorithm is a method for solving linear programming problems. It starts with an initial feasible solution and then iteratively  moves to other solutions that are better (i.e., have higher or lower objective function values) until it finds the optimal solution or proves that none exists. The algorithm works by finding the direction in which the objective function can be improved the most and then moving in that direction as far as possible while still remaining feasible. At each iteration, it selects one of the variables to be the "pivot" and re-organizes the constraints and objective function in order to move to the next solution. The process continues until the objective function can no longer be improved or an unbounded solution is found.

### Introduction to Linear Programming

Move from one vertex of the polyhedron to an adjacent vertex, increasing the value of the objective function, until you find thevertex with the maximum value.

1. Formulate the problem in a system of linear equations.
2. Transform it into the standard by adding slack variables that represents the difference between the inequality & the equality.
3. Represent as a canonical tableau

#### Pivot rule

The pivot rule is a method used in linear programming to solve a system of linear equations by converting it into a standard form known as the canonical form. The pivot rule involves selecting a pivot element (usually the element with the largest absolute value) from the objective function or a constraint and using it as the basis for the next iteration of the simplex algorithm. This process is repeated until the optimal solution is found or it is determined that no solution exists.

Initial solutions => feasible solutions 
Artificial variables (same as slack variables? ) $\to 0$

#### Two phases method

$$\operatorname{min} e^T x_ a$$
$$A x + x_ a = b$$
$$x, x_ a ≥ 0$$

If $x_ a$

#### Big M method

The Big M method is a technique used to convert certain types of constraints in a linear programming problem into a standard form that can be solved using simplex method. It is used to handle constraints that are not in the standard form of "less than or equal to" or "greater than or equal to" a constant.

The basic idea of the Big M method is to introduce a new variable called a "surrogate variable" or "slack variable" (in this case x_a) and to add the constraint:
$$\operatorname{min} c^T x + Me^T x_ a$$
$$A x + x_ a = b$$
$$x, x_ a ≥ 0$$

#### Degenerescence

A linear program is non-degenerated iff the basic variables of any feasible solution are positive. Therefore, input variables may to be positive.

## Duality, main concept in linear programming

It gives the *proof of optimality* not only on the *algorithmic level* but also in *combinatorics*
